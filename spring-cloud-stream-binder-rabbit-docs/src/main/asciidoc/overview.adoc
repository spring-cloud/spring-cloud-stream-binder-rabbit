This guide describes the RabbitMQ implementation of the Spring Cloud Stream Binder.
It contains information about its design, usage and configuration options, as well as information on how the Stream Cloud Stream concepts map into RabbitMQ specific constructs.
--

== Usage

To use the RabbitMQ binder, you can add it to your Spring Cloud Stream application, by using the following Maven coordinates:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-cloud-stream-binder-rabbit</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

Alternatively, you can use the Spring Cloud Stream RabbitMQ Starter, as follows:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-stream-rabbit</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

== RabbitMQ Binder Overview

The following simplified diagram shows how the RabbitMQ binder operates:

.RabbitMQ Binder
image::rabbit-binder.png[width=300,scaledwidth="50%"]

By default, the RabbitMQ Binder implementation maps each destination to a `TopicExchange`.
For each consumer group, a `Queue` is bound to that `TopicExchange`.
Each consumer instance has a corresponding RabbitMQ `Consumer` instance for its group's `Queue`.
For partitioned producers and consumers, the queues are suffixed with the partition index and use the partition index as the routing key.
For anonymous consumers (those with no `group` property), an auto-delete queue (with a randomized unique name) is used.

By using the optional `autoBindDlq` option, you can configure the binder to create and configure dead-letter queues (DLQs) (and a dead-letter exchange `DLX`, as well as routing infrastructure).
By default, the dead letter queue has the name of the destination, appended with `.dlq`.
If retry is enabled (`maxAttempts > 1`), failed messages are delivered to the DLQ after retries are exhausted.
If retry is disabled (`maxAttempts = 1`), you should set `requeueRejected` to `false` (the default) so that failed messages are routed to the DLQ, instead of being re-queued.
In addition, `republishToDlq` causes the binder to publish a failed message to the DLQ (instead of rejecting it).
This feature lets additional information (such as the stack trace in the `x-exception-stacktrace` header) be added to the message in headers.
This option does not need retry enabled.
You can republish a failed message after just one attempt.
Starting with version 1.2, you can configure the delivery mode of republished messages.
See the <<spring-cloud-stream-rabbit-republish-delivery-mode,`republishDeliveryMode` property>>.

IMPORTANT: Setting `requeueRejected` to `true` (with `republishToDlq=false` ) causes the message to be re-queued and redelivered continually, which is likely not what you want unless the reason for the failure is transient.
In general, you should enable retry within the binder by setting `maxAttempts` to greater than one or by setting `republishToDlq` to `true`.

See <<rabbit-binder-properties>> for more information about these properties.

The framework does not provide any standard mechanism to consume dead-letter messages (or to re-route them back to the primary queue).
Some options are described in <<rabbit-dlq-processing>>.

NOTE: When multiple RabbitMQ binders are used in a Spring Cloud Stream application, it is important to disable 'RabbitAutoConfiguration' to avoid the same configuration from `RabbitAutoConfiguration` being applied to the two binders.
You can exclude the class by using the `@SpringBootApplication` annotation.

Starting with version 2.0, the `RabbitMessageChannelBinder` sets the `RabbitTemplate.userPublisherConnection` property to `true` so that the non-transactional producers avoid deadlocks on consumers, which can happen if cached connections are blocked because of a https://www.rabbitmq.com/memory.html[memory alarm] on the broker.

== Configuration Options

This section contains settings specific to the RabbitMQ Binder and bound channels.

For general binding configuration options and properties, see the https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-stream/blob/master/spring-cloud-stream-core-docs/src/main/asciidoc/spring-cloud-stream-overview.adoc#configuration-options[Spring Cloud Stream core documentation].

[[rabbit-binder-properties]]
=== RabbitMQ Binder Properties

By default, the RabbitMQ binder uses Spring Boot's `ConnectionFactory`.
Conseuqently, it supports all Spring Boot configuration options for RabbitMQ.
(For reference, see the https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#common-application-properties[Spring Boot documentation]).
RabbitMQ configuration options use the `spring.rabbitmq` prefix.

In addition to Spring Boot options, the RabbitMQ binder supports the following properties:

spring.cloud.stream.rabbit.binder.adminAddresses::
A comma-separated list of RabbitMQ management plugin URLs.
Only used when `nodes` contains more than one entry.
Each entry in this list must have a corresponding entry in `spring.rabbitmq.addresses`.
Only needed if you use a RabbitMQ cluster and wish to consume from the node that hosts the queue.
See https://docs.spring.io/spring-amqp/reference/html/_reference.html#queue-affinity[Queue Affinity and the LocalizedQueueConnectionFactory] for more information.
+
Default: empty.
spring.cloud.stream.rabbit.binder.nodes::
A comma-separated list of RabbitMQ node names.
When more than one entry, used to locate the server address where a queue is located.
Each entry in this list must have a corresponding entry in `spring.rabbitmq.addresses`.
Only needed if you use a RabbitMQ cluster and wish to consume from the node that hosts the queue.
See https://docs.spring.io/spring-amqp/reference/html/_reference.html#queue-affinity[Queue Affinity and the LocalizedQueueConnectionFactory] for more information.

NOTE: In the case of RabbitMQ, content type headers can be set by external applications.
Spring Cloud Stream supports them as part of an extended internal protocol used for any type of transport -- including transports, such as Kafka (prior to 0.11), that do not natively support headers.

== Retry With the RabbitMQ Binder

When retry is enabled within the binder, the listener container thread is suspended for any back off periods that are configured.
This might be important when strict ordering is required with a single consumer. However, for other use cases, it prevents other messages from being processed on that thread.
An alternative to using binder retry is to set up dead lettering with time to live on the dead-letter queue (DLQ) as well as dead-letter configuration on the DLQ itself.
See "`<<rabbit-binder-properties>>`" for more information about the properties discussed here.
You can use the following example configuration to enable this feature:

* Set `autoBindDlq` to `true`.
The binder create a DLQ.
Optionally, you can specify a name in `deadLetterQueueName`.
* Set `dlqTtl` to the back off time you want to wait between redeliveries.
* Set the `dlqDeadLetterExchange` to the default exchange.
Expired messages from the DLQ are routed to the original queue, because the default `deadLetterRoutingKey` is the queue name (`destination.group`).
Setting to the default exchange is achieved by setting the property with no value, as shown in the next example.

To force a message to be dead-lettered, either throw an `AmqpRejectAndDontRequeueException` or set `requeueRejected` to `true` (the default) and throw any exception.

The loop continue without end, which is fine for transient problems, but you may want to give up after some number of attempts.
Fortunately, RabbitMQ provides the `x-death` header, which lets you determine how many cycles have occurred.

To acknowledge a message after giving up, throw an `ImmediateAcknowledgeAmqpException`.

=== Putting it All Together

The following configuration creates an exchange `myDestination` with queue `myDestination.consumerGroup` bound to a topic exchange with a wildcard routing key `#`:

[source]
---
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.destination=myDestination
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.group=consumerGroup
#disable binder retries
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.consumer.max-attempts=1
#dlx/dlq setup
spring.cloud.stream.rabbit.bindings.input.consumer.auto-bind-dlq=true
spring.cloud.stream.rabbit.bindings.input.consumer.dlq-ttl=5000
spring.cloud.stream.rabbit.bindings.input.consumer.dlq-dead-letter-exchange=
---

This configuration creates a DLQ bound to a direct exchange (`DLX`) with a routing key of `myDestination.consumerGroup`.
When messages are rejected, they are routed to the DLQ.
After 5 seconds, the message expires and is routed to the original queue by using the queue name as the routing key, as shown in the following example:

.Spring Boot application
[source, java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableBinding(Sink.class)
public class XDeathApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(XDeathApplication.class, args);
    }

    @StreamListener(Sink.INPUT)
    public void listen(String in, @Header(name = "x-death", required = false) Map<?,?> death) {
        if (death != null && death.get("count").equals(3L)) {
            // giving up - don't send to DLX
            throw new ImmediateAcknowledgeAmqpException("Failed after 4 attempts");
        }
        throw new AmqpRejectAndDontRequeueException("failed");
    }

}
----

Notice that the count property in the `x-death` header is a `Long`.

[[rabbit-error-channels]]
== Error Channels

Starting with version 1.3, the binder unconditionally sends exceptions to an error channel for each consumer destination and can also be configured to send async producer send failures to an error channel.
See "`<<binder-error-channels>>`" for more information.

RabbitMQ has two types of send failures:

* Returned messages,
* Negatively acknowledged https://www.rabbitmq.com/confirms.html[Publisher Confirms].

The latter is rare.
According to the RabbitMQ documentation "[A nack] will only be delivered if an internal error occurs in the Erlang process responsible for a queue.".

As well as enabling producer error channels (as described in "`<<binder-error-channels>>`"), the RabbitMQ binder only sends messages to the channels if the connection factory is appropriately configured, as follows:

* `ccf.setPublisherConfirms(true);`
* `ccf.setPublisherReturns(true);`

When using Spring Boot configuration for the connection factory, set the following properties:

* `spring.rabbitmq.publisher-confirms`
* `spring.rabbitmq.publisher-returns`

The payload of the `ErrorMessage` for a returned message is a `ReturnedAmqpMessageException` with the following properties:

* `failedMessage`: The spring-messaging `Message<?>` that failed to be sent.
* `amqpMessage`: The raw spring-amqp `Message`.
* `replyCode`: An integer value indicating the reason for the failure (for example, 312 - No route).
* `replyText`: A text value indicating the reason for the failure (for example, `NO_ROUTE`).
* `exchange`: The exchange to which the message was published.
* `routingKey`: The routing key used when the message was published.

For negatively acknowledged confirmations, the payload is a `NackedAmqpMessageException` with the following properties:

* `failedMessage`: The spring-messaging `Message<?>` that failed to be sent.
* `nackReason`: A reason (if available -- you may need to examine the broker logs for more information).

There is no automatic handling of these exceptions (such as sending to a <<rabbit-dlq-processing, dead-letter queue>>).
You can consume these exceptions with your own Spring Integration flow.

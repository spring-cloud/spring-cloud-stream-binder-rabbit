== Introduction
This is Rabbitmq specific implementation for Spring Cloud Stream Binder.
In the following sections, you can find more details
on how you can work with Spring Cloud Stream Rabbit binder,
in what concerns mapping the Spring Cloud Stream concepts onto the middleware concepts.

==== Classpath Detection

By default, Spring Cloud Stream relies on Spring Boot's auto-configuration to configure the binding process.
Following are the maven coordinates for including the Rabbitmq binder in a Spring Cloud Stream application.

==== Rabbit Binder Overview

.Rabbit Binder
image::rabbit-binder.png[width=300,scaledwidth="50%"]

The RabbitMQ Binder implementation maps the destination to a `TopicExchange`.
For each consumer group, a `Queue` will be bound to that `TopicExchange`.
Each consumer instance that binds will trigger creation of a corresponding RabbitMQ `Consumer` instance for its group's `Queue`.

== Configuration Options and Properties

For common configuration options and properties pertaining to binder,
Please refer to the https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-stream/blob/master/spring-cloud-stream-docs/src/main/asciidoc/spring-cloud-stream-overview.adoc#configuration-options[core docs].

=== RabbitMQ Binder-Specific Settings

The following binder, consumer, and producer properties are specific to the RabbitMQ binder implementation.

==== RabbitMQ Binder Properties

By default, the RabbitMQ binder uses Spring Boot's `ConnectionFactory`, and it therefore supports all Spring Boot configuration options for RabbitMQ.
(For reference, consult the http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#common-application-properties[Spring Boot documentation].) RabbitMQ configuration options use the `spring.rabbitmq` prefix.

In addition to the Spring Boot options, the RabbitMQ binder supports the following properties:

spring.cloud.stream.rabbit.binder.adminAddresses::
  A comma-separated list of RabbitMQ management plugin URLs.
Only used when `nodes` contains more than one entry.
Each entry in this list must have a corresponding entry in `spring.rabbitmq.addresses`.
+
Default: empty.
spring.cloud.stream.rabbit.binder.nodes::
  A comma-separated list of RabbitMQ node names.
When more than one entry, used to locate the server address where a queue is located.
Each entry in this list must have a corresponding entry in `spring.rabbitmq.addresses`.
+
Default: empty.
spring.cloud.stream.rabbit.binder.compressionLevel::
  Compression level for compressed bindings.
See `java.util.zip.Deflater`.
+
Default: `1` (BEST_LEVEL).

==== RabbitMQ Consumer Properties

The following properties are available for Rabbit consumers only and
must be prefixed with `spring.cloud.stream.rabbit.bindings.<channelName>.consumer.`.

acknowledgeMode::
  The acknowledge mode.
+
Default: `AUTO`.
autoBindDlq::
  Whether to automatically declare the DLQ and bind it to the binder DLX.
+
Default: `false`.
durableSubscription::
  Whether subscription should be durable.
Only effective if `group` is also set.
+
Default: `true`.
maxConcurrency::
  Default: `1`.
prefetch::
  Prefetch count.
+
Default: `1`.
prefix::
  A prefix to be added to the name of the `destination` and queues.
+
Default: "".
recoveryInterval::
  The interval between connection recovery attempts, in milliseconds.
+
Default: `5000`.
requeueRejected::
  Whether delivery failures should be requeued.
+
Default: `true`.
requestHeaderPatterns::
  The request headers to be transported.
+
Default: `[STANDARD_REQUEST_HEADERS,'*']`.
replyHeaderPatterns::
  The reply headers to be transported.
+
Default: `[STANDARD_REQUEST_HEADERS,'*']`.
republishToDlq::
  By default, messages which fail after retries are exhausted are rejected.
If a dead-letter queue (DLQ) is configured, RabbitMQ will route the failed message (unchanged) to the DLQ.
If set to `true`, the bus will republish failed messages to the DLQ with additional headers, including the exception message and stack trace from the cause of the final failure.
transacted::
  Whether to use transacted channels.
+
Default: `false`.
txSize::
  The number of deliveries between acks.
+
Default: `1`.

==== Rabbit Producer Properties

The following properties are available for Rabbit producers only and
must be prefixed with `spring.cloud.stream.rabbit.bindings.<channelName>.producer.`.

autoBindDlq::
  Whether to automatically declare the DLQ and bind it to the binder DLX.
+
Default: `false`.
batchingEnabled::
  Whether to enable message batching by producers.
+
Default: `false`.
batchSize::
  The number of messages to buffer when batching is enabled.
+
Default: `100`.
batchBufferLimit::
  Default: `10000`.
batchTimeout::
  Default: `5000`.
compress::
  Whether data should be compressed when sent.
+
Default: `false`.
deliveryMode::
  Delivery mode.
+
Default: `PERSISTENT`.
prefix::
  A prefix to be added to the name of the `destination` exchange.
+
Default: "".
requestHeaderPatterns::
  The request headers to be transported.
+
Default: `[STANDARD_REQUEST_HEADERS,'*']`.
replyHeaderPatterns::
  The reply headers to be transported.
+
Default: `[STANDARD_REQUEST_HEADERS,'*']`.

[NOTE]
====
In the case of RabbitMQ, content type headers can be set by external applications.
Spring Cloud Stream supports them as part of an extended internal protocol used for any type of transport (including transports, such as Kafka, that do not normally support headers).

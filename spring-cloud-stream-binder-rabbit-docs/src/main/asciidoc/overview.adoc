This guide describes the RabbitMQ implementation of the Spring Cloud Stream Binder.
It contains information about its design, usage and configuration options, as well as information on how the Stream Cloud Stream concepts map into RabbitMQ specific constructs.
--

== Usage

For using the RabbitMQ binder, you just need to add it to your Spring Cloud Stream application, using the following Maven coordinates:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-cloud-stream-binder-rabbit</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

Alternatively, you can also use the Spring Cloud Stream RabbitMQ Starter.

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-stream-rabbit</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

== RabbitMQ Binder Overview

A simplified diagram of how the RabbitMQ binder operates can be seen below.

.RabbitMQ Binder
image::rabbit-binder.png[width=300,scaledwidth="50%"]

The RabbitMQ Binder implementation maps each destination to a `TopicExchange`.
For each consumer group, a `Queue` will be bound to that `TopicExchange`.
Each consumer instance have a corresponding RabbitMQ `Consumer` instance for its group's `Queue`.
For partitioned producers/consumers the queues are suffixed with the partition index and use the partition index as routing key.

Using the `autoBindDlq` option, you can optionally configure the binder to create and configure dead-letter queues (DLQs) (and a dead-letter exchange `DLX`).
The dead letter queue has the name of the destination, appended with `.dlq`.
If retry is enabled (`maxAttempts > 1`) failed messages will be delivered to the DLQ.
If retry is disabled (`maxAttempts = 1`), you should set `requeueRejected` to `false` (default) so that a failed message will be routed to the DLQ, instead of being requeued.
In addition, `republishToDlq` causes the binder to publish a failed message to the DLQ (instead of rejecting it); this enables additional information to be added to the message in headers, such as the stack trace in the `x-exception-stacktrace` header.
This option does not need retry enabled; you can republish a failed message after just one attempt.

IMPORTANT: Setting `requeueRejected` to `true` will cause the message to be requeued and redelivered continually, which is likely not what you want unless the failure issue is transient.
In general, it's better to enable retry within the binder by setting `maxAttempts` to greater than one, or set `republishToDlq` to `true`.

See <<rabbit-binder-properties>> for more information about these properties.

The framework does not provide any standard mechanism to consume dead-letter messages (or to re-route them back to the primary queue).
Some options are described in <<rabbit-dlq-processing>>.

== Configuration Options

This section contains settings specific to the RabbitMQ Binder and bound channels.

For general binding configuration options and properties,
please refer to the https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-stream/blob/master/spring-cloud-stream-docs/src/main/asciidoc/spring-cloud-stream-overview.adoc#configuration-options[Spring Cloud Stream core documentation].

[[rabbit-binder-properties]]
=== RabbitMQ Binder Properties

By default, the RabbitMQ binder uses Spring Boot's `ConnectionFactory`, and it therefore supports all Spring Boot configuration options for RabbitMQ.
(For reference, consult the https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#common-application-properties[Spring Boot documentation].)
RabbitMQ configuration options use the `spring.rabbitmq` prefix.

In addition to Spring Boot options, the RabbitMQ binder supports the following properties:

spring.cloud.stream.rabbit.binder.adminAddresses::
  A comma-separated list of RabbitMQ management plugin URLs.
Only used when `nodes` contains more than one entry.
Each entry in this list must have a corresponding entry in `spring.rabbitmq.addresses`.
+
Default: empty.
spring.cloud.stream.rabbit.binder.nodes::
  A comma-separated list of RabbitMQ node names.
When more than one entry, used to locate the server address where a queue is located.
Each entry in this list must have a corresponding entry in `spring.rabbitmq.addresses`.
+
Default: empty.
spring.cloud.stream.rabbit.binder.compressionLevel::
  Compression level for compressed bindings.
See `java.util.zip.Deflater`.
+
Default: `1` (BEST_LEVEL).

=== RabbitMQ Consumer Properties

The following properties are available for Rabbit consumers only and
must be prefixed with `spring.cloud.stream.rabbit.bindings.<channelName>.consumer.`.

acknowledgeMode::
  The acknowledge mode.
+
Default: `AUTO`.
autoBindDlq::
  Whether to automatically declare the DLQ and bind it to the binder DLX.
+
Default: `false`.
bindingRoutingKey::
  The routing key with which to bind the queue to the exchange (if `bindQueue` is `true`).
  for partitioned destinations `-<instanceIndex>` will be appended.
+
Default: `#`.
bindQueue::
  Whether to bind the queue to the destination exchange; set to `false` if you have set up your own infrastructure and have previously created/bound the queue.
+
Default: `true`.
declareExchange::
  Whether to declare the exchange for the destination.
+
Default: `true`.
delayedExchange::
  Whether to declare the exchange as a `Delayed Message Exchange` - requires the delayed message exchange plugin on the broker.
  The `x-delayed-type` argument is set to the `exchangeType`.
+
Default: `false`.
durableSubscription::
  Whether subscription should be durable.
Only effective if `group` is also set.
+
Default: `true`.
exchangeAutoDelete::
  If `declareExchange` is true, whether the exchange should be auto-delete (removed after the last queue is removed).
+
Default: `true`.
exchangeDurable::
  If `declareExchange` is true, whether the exchange should be durable (survives broker restart).
+
Default: `true`.
exchangeType::
  The exchange type; `direct`, `fanout` or `topic` for non-partitioned destinations; `direct` or `topic` for partitioned destinations.
+
Default: `topic`.
maxConcurrency::
  Default: `1`.
prefetch::
  Prefetch count.
+
Default: `1`.
prefix::
  A prefix to be added to the name of the `destination` and queues.
+
Default: "".

republishToDlq::
  By default, messages which fail after retries are exhausted are rejected.
If a dead-letter queue (DLQ) is configured, RabbitMQ will route the failed message (unchanged) to the DLQ.

[NOTE]
====
In the case of RabbitMQ, content type headers can be set by external applications.
Spring Cloud Stream supports them as part of an extended internal protocol used for any type of transport (including transports, such as Kafka, that do not normally support headers).

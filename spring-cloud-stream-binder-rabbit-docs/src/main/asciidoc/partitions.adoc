== Partitioning with the RabbitMQ Binder

RabbitMQ does not support partitioning natively.

Sometimes it is advantageous to send data to specific partitions, for example when you want to strictly order message processing - all messages for a particular customer should go to the same partition.

The `RabbitMessageChannelBinder` provides partitioning by binding a queue for each partition to the destination exchange.

The following illustrates how to configure the producer and consumer side:

.Producer
[source, java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableBinding(Source.class)
public class RabbitPartitionProducerApplication {

    private static final Random RANDOM = new Random(System.currentTimeMillis());

    private static final String[] data = new String[] {
            "foo1", "bar1", "qux1",
            "foo2", "bar2", "qux2",
            "foo3", "bar3", "qux3",
            "foo4", "bar4", "qux4",
            };

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new SpringApplicationBuilder(RabbitPartitionProducerApplication.class)
            .web(false)
            .run(args);
    }

    @InboundChannelAdapter(channel = Source.OUTPUT, poller = @Poller(fixedRate = "5000"))
    public Message<?> generate() {
        String value = data[RANDOM.nextInt(data.length)];
        System.out.println("Sending: " + value);
        return MessageBuilder.withPayload(value)
                .setHeader("partitionKey", value)
                .build();
    }

}

.application.yml
[source, yaml]
----
    spring:
      cloud:
        stream:
          bindings:
            output:
              destination: partitioned.destination
              producer:
                partitioned: true
                partition-key-expression: headers['partitionKey']
                partition-count: 2
                required-groups:
                - myGroup
----

[NOTE]
====
The above configuration uses the default partitioning (`key.hashCode() % partitionCount`).
This may or may not provide a suitably balanced algorithm, depending on the key values; you can override this default by using the `partitionSelectorExpression` or `partitionSelectorClass` properties.

The `required-groups` property is only required if you need the consumer queues to be provisioned when the producer is deployed.
Otherwise, any messages sent to a partition will be lost until the corresponding consumer is deployed.

This configuration provisions a topic exchange:

image::part-exchange.png[scaledwidth="50%"]

and these queues bound to that exchange:

image::part-queues.png[scaledwidth="50%"]

with these bindings:

image::part-bindings.png[scaledwidth="50%"]

.Consumer
[source, java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableBinding(Sink.class)
public class RabbitPartitionConsumerApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new SpringApplicationBuilder(RabbitPartitionConsumerApplication.class)
            .web(false)
            .run(args);
    }

    @StreamListener(Sink.INPUT)
    public void listen(@Payload String in, @Header(AmqpHeaders.CONSUMER_QUEUE) String queue) {
        System.out.println(in + " received from queue " + queue);
    }

}

.application.yml
[source, yaml]
----
    spring:
      cloud:
        stream:
          bindings:
            input:
              destination: partitioned.destination
              group: myGroup
              consumer:
                partitioned: true
                instance-index: 0
----

IMPORTANT: The `RabbitMessageChannelBinder` does not support dynamic scaling; there must be at least one consumer per partition.
The consumer's `instanceIndex` is used to indicate which partition will be consumed.
On platforms such as Cloud Foundry there can only be one instance with an `instanceIndex`.
